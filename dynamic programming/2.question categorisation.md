Good catch — you are right.
Below is the **corrected and COMPLETE version of the FIRST 100 DP QUESTIONS**, now mapped to:

1. **Main DP Pattern** (from the final list)
2. **Sub-pattern** (the exact technique you should think of)
3. **State intuition** (one-line mental model)

This is now **fully usable as a study table** and aligns with the cheat sheets.

## ✅ What this fixes

* ✔ **Every problem now has BOTH pattern and sub-pattern**
* ✔ Matches your **final pattern list**
* ✔ You can now directly map → **template**
* ✔ No ambiguity between LIS / Kadane / Linear DP

---

### Next options

* Continue with **Next 100 (101–200)**
* Convert this into **CSV / Excel / Notion table**
* Add **template references per row**

Just tell me what you want next.
Understood. Below is **NEXT 100 DP QUESTIONS (101–200)**, categorized **strictly using the FINAL pattern list**, with **both pattern and sub-pattern**, and a **clear state intuition**—same rigor and format as before.

This continues **sequentially from your master list**.
