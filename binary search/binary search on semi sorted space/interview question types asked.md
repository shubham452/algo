## 🧠 How Interviewers Escalate Difficulty

1️⃣ **Simple sorted array**
2️⃣ **Rotated array**
3️⃣ **Rotated + duplicates**
4️⃣ **Binary search on answer**
5️⃣ **Proof & invariants**

If you fail at step 2 → interview ends.

## 🎯 What YOU Should Prioritize (Smart Prep)

Since you’re already strong in DSA, do this:

### ✅ Must-Do (90% Coverage)

* Find Peak Element
* Find Minimum in Rotated Array
* Search in Rotated Sorted Array
* Binary Search on Answer (Koko, Capacity)

### 🚀 Differentiators (Top 10%)

* Rotated + duplicates
* Parity pattern problems
* Explaining invariants out loud

## 🧠 Interview Golden Sentence

Use this when stuck:

> “At any index, at least one half is guaranteed to satisfy a monotonic property, allowing binary search.”

Interviewers **love** this.
